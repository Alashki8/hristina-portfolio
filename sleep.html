            <p>This is "The Sleep Over Project". It represents a graphic design of my dream village house for a sleep over with my friends on 
                vacations. It has two floors, a huge garage, beautiful terrace with my favourite flowers, two big trees respectively positioned one on the left side of the house, 
                and the other - on the right. The colors represent the culture of my village, very traditional, as the brown showcase the 
                fertile soil of Bulgaria, the white windows - the liberty connected to the white pigeon which is the symbol of peace. The house is designed by the architecture of the 
                renaissance Bulgarians from the past 300 years.

            <p>This is the paper prototype of the graphic design of the sleep over house. It's black and white, as after finishing the structure
                 I added colors and nature, like flowers, trees, grass, sky, ect. I made the garage bigger than usual, because my cicle of friends
                  it's kind of big and almost all of them drive cars, so it will be more efficient for every one to have a car 
                  spot either inside of the garage or in front of the house. The second floor has a terrace for the smokers and big bedrooms, so that every couple or single can have his perfect place for "The Sleep Over".

                After finishing the paper prototype, I had to use programms like Illustrator and Photoshop. With the Illustrator, I made the black and white design colored, more clean, more 3D type, with an actual vision and started to make the project get more in shape. The last thing I needed to do, was to make better components by using Photoshop, which helped me with the detailes like the front door, the trees, the flowers and the 
                ceiling.i had great experience of the project, as i was drawing, designing and photoshoping, which makes me excited for my new adventure in the Netherlands studying Graphic design.
