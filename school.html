                    <img src="../static/img/24 Май.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="one" alt="I really like this project because it's one of the national holidays here in Bulgaria. 24th of May represents st. Kiril and Metodi who created the bulgarian language, literacy 
                    and culture. They are one of the first teachers in Bulgaria who taught the students of the Cyrillic alphabet in year 886. Evidence of the celebration of the holiday was found in the Armenian chronicle of 1813, 
                    where it is mentioned to be celebrated on May 22, 1813 in Shumen (The date of May 22 in this chronicle can be assumed to be of the so-called new style - the Gregorian calendar). 
                    There are reports that the organizers of this celebration in 1813 were Gagauz people from Shumen. On year 1857 the holiday started to grow in Bulgaria most people started to 
                    celebrate it in the other cities so as in Sofia, the capital city in Bulagria." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/книга.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="two" alt="Here is a cover of a book I remade. This is a project from high school where we had to remade a cover of an old book. I chose this book ,,Comet'' because I love the Space 
                    and because I had so much ideas of how I can reamde the cover, too. The authors describe in the book the scientific nature of comets, as well as their varying roles and perceptions 
                    throughout history, and the evolution of human understanding of comets. I decided to do not change much things because I wanted to save the aesthetic of this beautifu cover.
                    I only changed the background to look like a new book and repositioned a little the text on the back of the book, and I really like how it came out." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/castle with waterfall.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="three" alt="This is also one of the projects I love. In the university gave us this project and we had to make one picture with castle and waterfall, and also to change the sky. 
                    I wanted to make something like magical castle in the clouds, something like a Disney castle. That's why I chose a high waterfall falling from a big rock. Then I added the castle
                    and some clouds so it can look like it's flying, and then I added a beautiful magical sky and corrected the shades, the brightness and the colour to look more realistic." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/chains and rope.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="one" alt="In this project you can see chains and a rope bent like the rock group ,,AC DC''. This also is a project from the university and they gave us a chain and a rope, and to make a word 
                    with them." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/Corona virus.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="two" alt="This is a little comics from high school about the Coronavirus. I made it when i was still the pandemic here in Bulgaria. It represents how our world is dying and how the other
                    people should stay at home. When people stay at home and healing the desease the world starts to get better and everyone start to go out again but with masks. And then after more 
                    time the people don't have to wear masks anymore and everything is so much better in thath way." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/covid 19 poster.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="three" alt="This is another Coronavirus project I made. Here I explain how to deal with the virus like to wash our hands, to put our hand on the mouth while sneezing, to have 
                    distance of 2 meters and etc. Also it says to stay at home so we don't catch the virus." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/плакат за инфлуенсър.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="three" alt="This is a poster about the famous influencer James Charles. It is about a new pallete that James Charles made. I decided to be James Charles because most girls like to 
                    put on make up and most of them use the pallete of James Charles. I made research about that and I saw that famous Tik Tok make up artist also use James Charles's pallete
                    because it has a lot of colours and because of that the make up artists make really beautiful make up that inspire other girls who love to put on make up. I also made a video
                    on the poster, it has to look like an ad which will show on the websites while browsing but sadly I didn't put it in the portfolio.

                    <img src="../static/img/drops on bottle.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="one" alt="In the university we had to make a drops on a bottle so we can practice our 3D skills for the future." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/elephant.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="two" alt="This project shows a big elephant versus the people. It represents how the massive growth of the population there is no space for the animals. Because of the massive population
                    there are more construction of buildings and in that way the nature is slowly dying, and because of that there is no home for the animals. Sure there are wildlife sanctuarys but
                    this is not much of a help for the animals. Because of this problem most animals are starting to disappear. That's why I created this project to show how an animal, maybe the last
                    of it's kind, walking versus the people to show how it is trying to survive on this planet." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/fire 3D text.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="three" alt="Here we had to make a 3D text. I chose to write the word fire. When I wrote ,,fire'' I added a shadow so it can look more realistic and the other detail that I added is on the 
                    text. I wanted to have a burnt out effect something like the fire was extinguished." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/fire car.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="one" alt="This car is transparent because that was the project they gave us, they gave us the car and the background. The idea of this project was to put the car in the photo and to 
                    make it look transparent, after that we had to add detailes and to make the car look like it's moving. For this car we had to use a lot of effects. It was really hard for  me 
                    to do it but however I succeeded." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/Music.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="two" alt="In this poster I put the headphones to represent the music. When we hear music we think about headphones or live music but I decided to put headphones because in this way 
                    you can listen to the music you like without interupting the others around you. It also shows how the music goes in the both ears for better experience and emotion." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/филмов плакат  v3.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="three" alt="This is a movie poster of the ,,Star Wars'' movie. We had to make a poster where we had to put an objects of the movie and someone to guess the movie. In this poster I decided to 
                    put the Star of Death and some starship of the movie. Of course, the objects in the poster look really obvious but this was the best way to represent the movie." width="160px" height="120px">
                    <img src="../static/img/контролно.jpg" class="thumbnail" id="three" alt="This car is actually with changed colours. In this project the teacher gave us a car and we had to change the colours of it. Except the colours we had to add a shadow and a 
                    details like we had to put building on the car window so it can look like a reflection. The colour of the car is red but it has a green on it because of the light." width="160px" height="120px">
