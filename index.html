                            <p>I graduated from Polygraphy and Photography highschool - from 8th grade to 12th grade. I was studying graphic design and also photography. We were learning about Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, also we were learning a little HTML. I was very good at photoshop because before highschool I was learning a lot about it. I graduated with great score in

                            <p>As hobbies I love skiing and drawing. We go skiing on weekends but not as often as before. Also I'm drawing since I was a child. I had a lot of ideas because of my imagination. I was drawing animation, anime and game characters, dragons and I tried to draw comics too. Big reason for that is my love for anime and manga. I also love photography and take pictures of the nature and portraits.

                            <p>I was born on 24th of October, year 2002. I live in Sofia, Bulgaria, so as my parents. I'm an only child in my family and my parents are divorced. Right now I live with my mom and her husband but my dad lives alone. I have a step brother, he's my step dad's son. He also lives in Sofia but we don't see eachother often. Sometimes we go out and have fun, we ride bicycles, we go out with friends and other stuff.
