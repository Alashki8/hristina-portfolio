            <img src="../static/img/3D wine bottle S CHEESE.png" alt="">
            <p>I illustrated a traditional Bulgarian wine barrel, the hard material, which has on top of it a home made red wine, produced 
                in the bowels of Varna city. It is poured in an elegant crystal glass of wine, the transparent material. Also, what is a Bulgarian drink without an appetizer, which in that case is the yellow cow cheese, the soft material. I call this project " The Sitting Object" as you need to see this more outside of the box, as nothing is what it seems. The truth behind the picture is that, almost every Bulgarian family has a sitting around a table, full of red wine, cheese, meat, and beautiful music, like traditional folk and pop-folk.

            <img src="../static/img/3D wine bottle.jpg" alt="" width="400px" height="450px">
            <p>This is the first protype of the project I created. Everything is made in Photoshop. The bottle is handmade in Photoshop 3D,
                I picked the colour green because the most wine bottles in Bulgaria are like this and the label is also handmade,
                and it represents one of the first bottles in Bulgaria ever made.
               The background represents a village because most of the wines are made in the villages.
                There they collect and revise the grapes in barrels and let it stay there for a long time so the wine has better taste.
                Initialy when I made the picture I wasn't thinking to put cheese on the picture but then I realised that the cheese is symbolic to the Bulgarians.
                Here in Bulgaria when we sit on the table to drink wine we always put an appetizer on the table, too. That gives the folklore aesthetic and it gives more taste to the wine.</p>
            <img src="../static/img/Screen Shot 2.jpg" alt="" width="400px" height="450px">
            <p>Here is how I work on the Photoshop. First of all, I made the 3D wine bottle and added the background, and later on I decided to add the cheese for more bulgarian aesthetic.
                It gives the vibe of a bulagrian wine because wine without apetizer isn't traditional. I searched for these details for a very long time.
                This project was very hard to do because there is so much bulgarian aesthetics, and I think the wine, cheese and the background is one of the most popular things in Bulgaria.
                The bottle also was very hard to do because I had to put so much details and make it look more realistic, and I had to position the label on the bottle. Later I had to put more 
                details on the bottle because of the backgroundso it can look like someone took a picture of a wine bottle outside in the nature. 
                I really liked working on this project because I wanted to show the other people around the world about our bulgarian culture and tradition.</p>
